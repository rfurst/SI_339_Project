            Finland is a Nordic country located near Sweden and Norway. It has 5.6 million citizens with its capital, Helsinki, being the most populated city. While Helsinki is a lively, urban area, Finland as a whole is fairly rural. For this reason Finland is a great setting for those who enjoy nature. Finland has a very cold climate, providing very snowy winters as well as a suitable environment for animals like reindeers.
